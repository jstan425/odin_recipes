    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>500g minced beef</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 carrot, diced</li>
        <li>1 celery stick, diced</li>
        <li>2 tbsp tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 cup beef stock</li>
        <li>1 tsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 package of puff pastry</li>
        <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 200°C (390°F).</li>
        <li>In a large pan, cook the minced beef over medium heat until browned. Drain excess fat.</li>
        <li>Add the chopped onion and minced garlic to the pan, cooking until softened.</li>
        <li>Stir in the diced carrot and celery, cooking for another 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the tomato paste, beef stock, Worcestershire sauce, salt, and pepper. Stir well and let the mixture simmer for about 15 minutes, or until the liquid has reduced.</li>
        <li>Roll out the puff pastry and line a pie dish with one sheet. Fill with the meat mixture.</li>
        <li>Cover the pie with the second sheet of puff pastry, sealing the edges by pressing them together. Make a few slits in the top to allow steam to escape.</li>
        <li>Brush the top of the pie with the beaten egg for a golden finish.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until the pastry is golden brown.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and let it cool slightly before serving. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
